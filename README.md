LazShopPH (@LazShopPHbot) is a free Telegram bot that acts as a shopping assistant for Filipino e-shoppers who use the e-commerce platforms Shopee and Lazada. The bot goes through product listings on both e-commerce platforms, saves the product names, prices, and links, and gives the top search results and cheapest finds for whatever product the user searches. 

To start, press /start. Type your desired query and wait for the bot to respond. The bot will output three (3) messages: (1), the first five search results on Lazada; (2), the first five search results on Shopee; and (3), the five cheapest items on both platforms.
